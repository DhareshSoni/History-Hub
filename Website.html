        <ul>
            <li>Before the widespread freedom movements, various small rebellions and resistance efforts challenged British expansion in India.</li>
            <li>Battle of Plassey (1757): Marked the beginning of British dominance in India after defeating the Nawab of Bengal.</li>
            <li>Sanyasi and Fakir Rebellions: Religious-led uprisings in Bengal and Bihar.</li>
            <li>Paika Rebellion (1817): Armed rebellion in Odisha against British economic policies.</li>
            <li>Vellore Mutiny (1806): One of the earliest military uprisings by Indian sepoys.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The First War of Independence (1857)</h3>
         <img src="https://organiser.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/whatsapp-image-2024-05-12-at-11.29.13.jpeg" alt="igg" width="650" height="250">
        <ul>
            <li>Also called the Sepoy Mutiny or 1857 Revolt, it was the first large-scale armed rebellion against British rule.</li>
            <li>Sparked by grievances of Indian soldiers (sepoys) over cartridge greasing rumors.</li>
            <li>Spread quickly across northern and central India.</li>
            <li>Though ultimately suppressed, it shook British confidence and led to the dissolution of the East India Company.</li>
            <li>The British Crown took direct control of India afterward (1858), beginning the British Raj era.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Formation of Indian National Congress (1885)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Founded as a forum for airing grievances and reform demands.</li>
            <li>Initially moderate in approach, seeking dialogue with the British government.</li>
            <li>Became the platform for political leadership of the freedom struggle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Early Nationalist Movements (1885–1915)</h3>

            <li>Called for self-rule (Swaraj), social reforms, and economic upliftment.</li>
            <li>Partition of Bengal (1905): British policy to divide Bengal sparked widespread protest and Swadeshi movement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mahatma Gandhi and Mass Movements (1915–1947)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mahatma Gandhi arrived in India in 1915 and transformed the freedom struggle with his philosophy of non-violence (Ahimsa) and civil disobedience.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Salt March (1930): Protest against the British salt tax; marked by Gandhi’s 240-mile march to the sea.</li>
            <li>Quit India Movement (1942): Mass protest demanding an immediate British withdrawal; many leaders imprisoned.</li>
        </ul>
